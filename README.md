# Marketing-Analytics-Python

## Overview
The goal for any good marketing campaign is to have a strategic effort by the company to raise awareness of a product being sold or to capture the attention of a customer. As a marketing analyst, it is one’s job to analyze the data on customers and find out why a marketing campaign may or may not be successful. Through the use of data analytics, an analyst can better understand the problem and present a data-driven solution to the correct stakeholders.

The data set analyzed in this report is a fictional dataset taken from the Advanced Data Analytics course in the Master of Science Business Analytics program at Hult International Business School. The data set can be accessed on Kaggle’s website: eCommerce Marketing Analytics. The entire analysis was run using Python and stored in a Jupyter Notebook. The methodology of analysis taken was to first use descriptive statistics to gain a better understanding of the company’s customer base. Next a predictive linear regression model was produced to help predict the number of store purchases for the company. Lastly, more descriptive analytics was performed to find out what campaign was most successful and what the average customer looked like for that campaign

This repository contains the dataset in a csv file, a final written report, and a python jupyter notebook displaying all the code used for analysis.
